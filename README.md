## Reasons/Approach to the task.

### Setup
First, I used create react app to save time to be able to focus more on the project at hand. As well as this, I added ESLINT to my project to lint my project to check for any styling errors/code mishaps (AIRBNB). 

I've also decided to go for the styled components approach to styling I find styled components to be easier to debug and a cleaner solution for react applications. Additionaly, I have decided to use Redux in my application, 
although the application is small the last time I attemped this tech test, I found the state start to become confusing and hard to debug, Redux should help me combat my state issues and help to clarify my data flow. 

Lastly, I've decided this time to tackle this challenge using functional components and hooks, this pairs really nicely with styled components and is also the best practise currently for writing react code.
